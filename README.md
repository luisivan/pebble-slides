pebble-slides
=============

Pebble app to toggle slides on Linux, Mac and Windows, includes chronometer and notes to make giving talks easier.

To make it work, you gotta install ws4py and PyUserInput, then run server.py on your Linux/Mac/Windows and copy the address it outputs to the configuration window of the app on your phone.

The app displays a chronometer and you can go back/forth in your slides using the Up and Down buttons.
You can also take notes in the app, and they will be displayed when you click the Select button.
You have to write one note per slide using the following format:

1. text of slide #1
2. text of slide #2, blablabla
3. you can figure out how it goes

Hope you like it!
